      <h2>When to visit</h2>
      <p>
        Located so far south in Europe, North Macedonia is great to visit most
        of the year round. It is particularly welcoming during spring and
        autumn, outside the high tourist seasons and when the weather is at its
        most pleasant. It can be warm and sunny during the day from as early as
        March until as late as November, while skiing is usually available from
        December through April.<br />
        The lake and town of Ohrid are seen as the jewel of North Macedonia’s
        crown, and it is not without reason that Ohrid’s medieval architecture
        and pristine natural setting are preserved by UNESCO as a place of
        historic, cultural and scenic significance. Outside the height of the
        summer season it remains a wonderful little getaway spot, and should not
        be missed on any trip to North Macedonia. The back route from Skopje
        through Debar to Struga and on to Ohrid is worth the extra time.

      <h2>Architecture and archaeology</h2>
      <p>
        Don’t miss out on the 16th-century villages of the Macedonian
        minorities. Galičnik of the Mijaks hangs on the edge of a deep ravine
        and every July holds the biggest wedding party you’ll ever go to.
        Malovište, located in Pelister National Park, is an old Vlach village,
        formerly housing rich traders, which is now being renovated to preserve
        its heritage and is a beautiful example of the rich variety of
        Macedonian culture. There are hundreds of other fine old villages off
        the beaten track that have yet to be fully discovered and you’ll find
        that taking a trip away from your main route will always reap a
        reward.<br />
        North Macedonia is literally buried in archaeological ruins, which are
        becoming more accessible every year: Neolithic villages can be found on
        Lake Ohrid and in Skopje; Cyclopean fortresses at Prosek and Mariovo;
        Roman towns at Heraklea and Stobi; and World War I battlefields at
        Dojran and outside Bitola. It’s also possible to take part in
        archaeological digs through the Balkan Heritage Field School.

      <h2>Spiritual inns</h2>
      <p>
        A trip to North Macedonia would be incomplete without at least visiting
        one monastery. They are renowned for their intricate woodwork and
        delicate architecture and for some of their remote but beautiful
        locations. The country boasted over 1,000 churches and monasteries at
        the zenith of Orthodox ministry in the region during the 14th to 16th
        centuries during which time Ohrid was the centre of the Orthodox Church
        and still has over 200 churches and monasteries overlooking its shores.
        Some of the most spectacular working monasteries to visit are Sv Joakim
        Osogovski near Kriva Palanki; Sv Jovan Bigorski near Debar; the World
        Monuments Fund-listed Treskavec Monastery near Prilep; Sv Gavril
        Lesnovski Kratovo; Kališta Monastery for its nearby cave churches
        looking over Lake Ohrid; and Zrze Monastery set high on a cliff.
